We are a new research group housed in the [Division of Informatics](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/informatics), [Deparment of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/) at the [Univerisity of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) [Perelman School of Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/).

Our group is broadly interested in the development and application of statistical and computational methods in genetics and genomics with a focus on complex traits. We are particularly interested in large-scale exploratory data analysis, causal inference, â€˜omic data integration, and cross-ancestry analysis. We use these techniques to analyse medically-linked genetic and multi-omic studies, single-cell sequencing and CRISPR-based screen data with the goal of understanding the mechanism of complex, common disease. The long-term goal of our group is to build large-scale, causally-grounded, multifactorial disease models that can be used to predict intervention effects, identify key pathways and ultimately enable precision medicine.

Our group benefits tremendously from the broad and robust genomics community at Penn. In particular: the [Penn Institute for Biomedical Informatics](https://ibi.med.upenn.edu/), the [Penn Center for Causal Inference](https://www.dbeicoe.med.upenn.edu/cci/about-us), and the [Center for Statistics in Biomedical Big Data](https://www.dbeicoe.med.upenn.edu/csbd). We collaborate with researchers from departments across the Univeristy including: biostatistics, genetics, statistics, computer science, psychiatry and more.

We are grateful to the NIH NHRGI, Penn DBEI, Penn IBI, and Penn Department of Genetics for their generous inital support of our group.

 **We are looking for trainees and staff at all levels** [(see openings)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!**

# Open positions

**We are recruiting talented scientists at all levels to work problems at the interface of machine learning, systems biology, functional genomics and statistical genetics.** Projects often involve high-dimensional "big data" analysis; integration of data across ancestry, modality, or phenotype; development of novel analysis methods, particularly within causal inference or machine learning; and/or collaboration with experimental groups. **We strongly support individuals seeking collaborative or co-mentorship relationships with other groups at Penn**.

Individuals with a strong background in statistics or machine learning, as well as individuals with a strong background in biological or phenotypic data analysis are encouraged to apply. In the latter case, co-mentorship arrangements may allow for an experimental component to your time in the group. We also have extensive experience teaching and mentoring trainees from marginalized communities. **Individuals with backgrounds that are traditionally underreprestend in science are strongly encouraged to apply**.

## Staff positions

### Postdoctoral researchers or staff scientists
We are hiring up to two post-doctoral researchers. To apply, please send a cover letter summarizing your accomplishments, skillset and interest in our group; your CV and one representative manuscript to brielin DOT brown AT pennmedicine DOT upenn DOT edu. 

Outstanding applicants with at least 3 years post-doctoral experience may be considered for a staff scientist position (official ad forthcoming). If appropriate, please indicate your interest in such a position in the cover letter.

### Post-baccalaureate researchers or data analyst/software engineers
We are seeking one outstanding post-baccalaureate data analyst or software engineer. Requirements include a BS/BS in a quantitative subject or biology with an emphasis on computational biology and experience with R or Python programming languages.

This can serve as an excellent chance to get hands-on research and/or coding experience before seeking further education or industry employment. If interested please send a cover letter summarizing your skillset, interest in our group and career goals; and your CV to brielin DOT brown AT pennmedicine DOT upenn DOT edu. Official job ad forthcoming.


## Graduate student positions
### PhD Students
We are affiliated with the [Graduate Group in Genomics and Computational Biology](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/) and the [Graduate Group in Epidemiology and Biostatistics](https://www.med.upenn.edu/ggeb/). Current undergraduate or masters students interested in joining the group as a PhD student should apply to one of these two programs and indicate interest in their application. Current Penn PhD students in these and other programs should feel free to reach out.

### Masters Students
We typically have room to support 1-2 MSc students from the [Master of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.med.upenn.edu/mbmi/about.html) or [Master of Biostatistics](https://www.med.upenn.edu/ggeb/about-biostatistics.html) programs. Current Penn MSc students should feel free to reach out.

## Undergraduate student positions
We typically have room to support 1-2 undergraduate students full-time in the summer and/or part-time during the semester. Undergraduate students will usually be paired with postdocs or senior graduate students, depending on availability. Support can come in the form of various summer programs at Penn, independent study course credit towards degree requirements, work-study, or directly from the group. Current Penn undergraduate students should feel free to reach out.
